## Introduction
In restaurants when the customer wants to place the order there will be no need to wait for the waiter to attend them, or make the customer unhappy by informing them about unavailability of items when they are placing the order. All these problems will be solved by replacing the physical printed menu card with a Digital Restaurant menu card where the experience of navigating through the menu is more effective. This solution is more dynamic since the owner can change the menu according to his wish and menu can be available in various languages.
